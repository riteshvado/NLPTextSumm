# NLPTextSumm
Project for NLP text summarization

We live in a world where we often get into signing “Privacy Policies” at work, mobile apps, purchase sites, loans etc.  I always thought I wish I had a browser/app plugin that can tell me important points from lengthy “Privacy Policies” document.  Automatic text summarization is one technique which can help us consolidating such large documents into concise summary for further digestion. In this project we will use NLP text summarization techniques to build a model which will help us derive concise important points from “Terms & Conditions” document. Scope of text summarization goes beyond the problem we are solving here. Text summarization can be obtained from multi-documents and then can be used in variety of other areas like:  
•	Producing highlights from multiple news articles from various sources.   
•	Search engines can cache summarized results and can rank results to more relevant pages on top. 
•	Further topic modeling can be done on summaries of documents. 

In this project my attempt is to learn & review how text summarization is performed in practice and how it can be further expanded to solve above examples.
